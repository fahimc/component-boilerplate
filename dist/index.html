                      <p>Component.js is <strong>1 - 6kb</strong> in file size on it's own. Since this framework is modular if you add the router and have es5 support then the file size is only <strong>9kb</strong>!</p>

                      <p>This framework is designed similar to Vuejs so if you've used Vuejs you will be familar with this.
                        <br>It focuses on SOC (separation of concern), HTML templates are in HTML, JS is within a JS file and Sass is used for css.</p>

                      <p>The concept of this framwork is to keep this minimal and it plays well with others. You can bolt on other libraries to add more features</p>

                      <p>Using the create task you can instantly generate a component. All the files are created with the base for each of them already created for you.</p>

            <p>This is a mini framework to build in a modular way by allowing you to build components just like in frameworks such as Vuejs, angular js and react. </p>
            <h1 id="whychoosethisframework">Why choose this framework?</h1>
            <p>This is not like other frameworks, you can bolt this framework on to existing projects and is designed to be a small footprint for projects with limited file sizes or projects which want to small I size as possible.</p>
            <p>The concept was created when there was a project that had a 150kb file size and there was a need for a component based architecture. This allows you to take control over what you feel is necessary for the project as <strong>component.js</strong>              only provides the bare minimum needed for building modular. </p>
            <p>There is a router and boilerplate which adds the basics for a full featured development process. Using this you can rapidly build projects.</p>
